    "__Tolerance degree__: represents what the agents are able to tolerate with respect to the character differences of the other agents that they approach. Like the shyness degree, it is possible to enter a value between 0 and 1 for a constant value in all nodes, or -1 to have different tolerance values for each individual approach.\n",
